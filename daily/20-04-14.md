## Contextual bandits methods

[How to build better contextual bandits machine learning models | Google Cloud Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-to-build-better-contextual-bandits-machine-learning-models)

[Contextual Bandits and Reinforcement Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/contextual-bandits-and-reinforcement-learning-6bdfeaece72a)

- direct method(DM) : estimates the reward function from given data and use this  to evaluate the policy value on a set of contexts
- inverse propensity score (IPS) : importance weighting to correct for the incorrect proportions of actions
- contextual bandit extends MAB where we factor in the customer's environment or context when choosing a bandit

## Accelerated learning from recommender systems using
multi-armed bandit

### Architecture

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06158.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06158.pdf)

- 4.1. Reward Sttribution Engine
    - receive msgs from user interaction events, recommender service event logs using Kafka Queue ⇒ generate Unified Data set
    - capture clicks, views, purchases
    - leverage a visitor based metric, not visit based to minimise statistical dependencies
- 4.2. MAB Daily Mini-batch
    - sufficient statistics (number of views and clicks ) to traffic allocation
    - Thomson sampling
- 4.3 Online Traffic Allocation Randomizer
- 4.4 Building a Robust System
    - seasonal issues
    - no globally optimal variant
        - each time period the optima may be different
        - means vanilla bandit → allocate zero traffics at the first mini-batch
        - **define a lower bound on the traffic allocation**
            - take traffics from winner to loser
- web crawlers and scrapers
    - skew the traffic allocation
        - mini-batch
        - traffic proportion computation run in nigtly batches , aggregate, not sensitive to noise
        - this aggregation reduces unbiased noise
        - and filter out the bot by detection service
- designed pipeeline so that in case we add a new variant mid-way
    - starts with uniform prior  → re-allocated at nightly batch
    - a black listing process, put a given variant into a black list to zero out the traffic the next day
- robustness
    - minibatch query does not change traffic allocation when  a breakage happens
        - This in-variance under no data condition
        is consistent with Bayesian principles.
