- dependency hell
- X.Y.Z (Major. Minor. Patch)
- when a major version is incremented → minor, patch set to zero
- Any modifications must be released as a new version.
- 0.y.z : initial dev. anything may change at any time. not stable
- 1.0.0 : public API.
- patch version Z : increment  if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced
- Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.
- A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a dash and a series of dot
    - 1.0.0-alpha.1
- A build version MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign
    - 1.0.0+build.1, 1.3.7+build.11.e0f985a

# Dart

- to get Dart packages, use pub package manager
- Dart runtime takes everything after *package:*

## Pubspec file

- pub package needs some metadata → specify its dependencies
    - Name : refer to your package name. all lowercase with underscores
    - Version : if omit → version 0.0.0
    - Dependencies : raison d’être
        - **dependencies** : regular dependencies
        - **dev_dependencies**: only needed in the dev phase
            - can use **dependency_overrides**
    - environment : Dart platform itself

        environment:  sdk: ">=2.1.0 <3.0.0"

## Dependency Sources

[Package dependencies](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies)

### SDK

- any SDKs shipped along with packages, which may themselves be dependencies
- Currently, Flutter is the only SDK that is supported

    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter

### Hosted packages

- downloded from [pub.dev](http://pub.dev) or another http server

    dependencies:
      transmogrify: ^1.4.0

### Git packages

    dependencies:
      kittens:
        git: git://github.com/munificent/kittens.git
