## Testing React components

- rendering component trees and asserting on their output
- running a complete app in a realistic browser (end-to-end)

## python deploy with WSGI

- using gunicorn as WSGI
- pip install gunicorn
- gunicorn application.wsgi —bind 127.0.0.1:8000

## Accelerated learning from recommender systems using MAB

[](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06158.pdf)

### Abstract

- A/B test is an unbiased and realistic way to evaluate models but the cost is high to explore.
- MAB can be a solution for this between offline and online A/B test

### Introduction

- A/B test
    - **gathering enough traffic** to reach statistical significance **can take long**
    - A/B testing is that it necessitates
    showing potentially **sub-optimal algorithms to the real-world marketplace**
- MAB
    - a MAB test starts with equal traffic devoted to each variant. However, that traffic allocation is changed after a short period
    according to the particular MAB design, increasing or decreasing
    traffic according to each variant’s performance and taking into
    account uncertainty for each variant in a principled way
    - While MAB testing can save time over traditional A/B testing,
    we have found in practice it cannot completely replace it. **MAB
    tests require a metric that is sensitive to change in a short period of
    time, like click-though rate, which may not correlate with a longer
    term metric used in the evaluation of an AB test.**
