# Transition Matrix

Last Edited: Apr 23, 2019 12:39 AM

## When can we use Transition Matrix?

- With Markov Chains Systems
    - modeling for predicting how states change with probability
    - hop from one state to another
- we need

1) state space : a list of all possible states

2) **probability** distribution(matrix) of transition from one to another

- so the matrix should be over zero
- sum of all probabilities in one column should be 1

3) no further assumption ! so it can be applied to many things 

4) mathematically , Markov matrix is in steady state
